This repository contains all orbital parameters of the constellations used in the numerical simulation and experimental study reported in the paper "Bi-objective optimization of OTV-based launch and deployment process for LEO constellation," submitted to the Chinese Journal of Aeronautics.

The other two folders contain the orbital parameters of the constellations used in my thesis at Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) and Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), respectively.

Each .mat file contains an N×6 matrix, where N is the constellation's satellite count. These six columns of data represent the semi-major axis, eccentricity, orbital inclination, right ascension of the ascending node, argument of perigee, and mean anomaly.
