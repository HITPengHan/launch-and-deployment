This repository contains all the orbital parameters of the constellations used for the numerical simulation and experimental study in the paper "Bi-objective optimization of OTV-based launch and deployment process for LEO constellation," submitted to the Chinese Journal of Aeronautics.

The other two folders contain the orbital parameters of the constellations used for my thesis at Harbin Institute of Technology and Hong Kong Polytechnic University, respectively.

Each .mat file is an N*6 matrix, where N is the constellation's satellite number. These six columns of data represent the semi-major axis, eccentricity, orbital inclination, right ascension of the ascending node, argument of perigee, and mean anomaly.
